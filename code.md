### Major League Hacking

- [**Green Geese**](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/Green-Geese/) - Sprint 2/6: Gaming<br>
  Green-Geese is a plant-themed Unity 2D platformer game. The player starts off as a seed, and has to jump up the platforms and avoid falling down. There will be powerups such as fertilizer and water that will help the seed grow and turn into a full grown plant. [**Play Here!**](https://zzranger.github.io/Green-Geese-Demo/)

- [**Best Geese**](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/Best-Geese/) - Sprint 1/6: Education<br>
